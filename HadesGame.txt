/** Description */

'Hades Game' is a fast-paced PVP Minigame, primarily based on the original survival mode of Minecraft.
As the game starts, players will be teleported to a random wild location. Players will get approximately 30 seconds of Life Regeneration. 
Your goal is to first escape from the crowd, develop your equipment (through standard Minecraft survival route), and eventually be the last one standing - by either fight against other players, or take advantage of 'Hades Events'.

The game includes dozens of random events, mostly unpredictable and astonishing (probably in a negative way, yes!). A while after the game starts, they will start to happen between time intervals.

Current featured 'Hades Events': Exchanging Position, Healing, Exchanging Backpack, Exchanging Life, Illuminating (Glow), Thunderstorm, Random Status Effect, Anvil Shower, Block Shower, Backpack Havoc, Triple Loot, Random Loot (Drops become random), Screwed.
There will also be a chance of Triple Event (Triple the event = Triple the hilariousity)

WARNing: this MOD is a highly customized version. There is NO configuration files, and can only be installed in the Server.
